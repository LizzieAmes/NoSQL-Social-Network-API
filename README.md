# NoSQL Social Network API

This project is a backend API for a social networking application. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Built with Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose ODM, it demonstrates CRUD operations for handling users, thoughts, friends, and reactions in a social network context.
